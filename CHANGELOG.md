# Changelog

Every release of LuauG. The format is [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and the versions are [semantic](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**The public surface is `api/api-dump.json`**, which is generated from the IDL
and diff-checked by CI. Anything that changes it is an entry here; anything that
does not is engine work and belongs in the git history rather than in this file.

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-22

The first release. Eleven milestones, M0 through M8, each signed off by a human
after playing what it built.

### The engine

- **A sandboxed Luau 0.734 VM** embedded directly, with `luaL_sandbox` on in
  every profile, `--!strict` under the new type solver everywhere, and the
  legacy scheduling globals (`wait`, `spawn`, `delay`, `tick`) absent rather
  than deprecated.
- **An Instance tree over a hand-rolled deterministic ECS**: `game`,
  `GetService`, `Instance.new`, `Parent`, `FindFirstChild`, attributes, tags,
  and `Clone`. A destroyed instance's handle stops resolving at the end of the
  drain in which `Destroying` fired, which is a keyed error instead of a silent
  read of a corpse.
- **Deferred-only signals** (ADR 0015) with `:Connect`, `:Once`, `:Wait` and
  `GetPropertyChangedSignal`, and `Signal<T...>` as a global datatype in place
  of `BindableEvent`.
- **A fixed 60 Hz simulation tick** with a variable render clock, five phase
  signals, and `task.spawn/defer/delay/wait/cancel`. **The renderer interpolates
  between ticks**, so a display faster than the simulation shows smooth motion.
- **Determinism as a gate, not a claim**: same build, same platform, same seed
  and inputs produce the same world hash at every checkpoint, replayed over
  10,000 ticks in CI (ADR 0025).

### Rendering

- **Forward PBR** with metallic-roughness materials, glTF 2.0 meshes, primitive
  parts, and a `Lighting` service that drives a physically-derived sky.
- **Four cascaded shadow maps** in one atlas, with a world-constant filter
  radius, normal-offset bias, a blend band rather than a switch at a plane, and
  a fit that keeps its box while the box still covers what casts.
- **Clustered forward shading** on a 16×9×24 grid: the light count stopped being
  eight.
- **Image-based lighting** by the split sum, with the sky as the environment, so
  a metal reflects the hour the script set.
- **A post chain**: depth prepass, screen-space ambient occlusion, automatic
  exposure with an artist control in EV stops, bloom, and FXAA.
- **Instanced draws**: 4,002 visible objects in 22 draw calls, against 15,390
  before.
- **A graphics settings family** (ADR 0044): `low`, `medium`, `high`, `ultra`,
  plus render scale, shadow resolution, cascade count and distance, light budget
  and post toggles — from `luaug.toml` and the command line, never from a scene.

### Physics

- **Jolt 5.6**, with rigid bodies, contacts surfaced as `Touched`, collision
  groups, raycasts and shapecasts, transform welds, and a `CharacterBody` that
  walks, jumps, climbs steps and rides moving platforms.

### The world

- **An offline asset pipeline**: assimp to canonical glTF, a content-addressed
  pack, and a build that is byte-identical across processes.
- **Chunk streaming** with a minimum ring that must be resident before a focus
  advances into it, hysteresis on eviction, and a materialisation budget in
  milliseconds rather than in chunks.
- **A per-world floating origin** (ADR 0014), verified identical at 10⁷ metres.
- **A job system** with work stealing, dependencies and a stable-merge commit.

### The game layer

- **The Input Action System** (ADR 0029): actions, contexts, bindings,
  rebindable at runtime, promptable, with a non-device channel a HUD button
  drives.
- **A UI tree** with `ScreenGui`, frames, labels, buttons, images, scrolling,
  `UDim2` layout, and text through a vendored Inter.
- **Tweens**, **audio** on the simulation timeline, and **skeletal animation**.

### Tooling

- **`luaug new`**, **`dev`** (hot reload under 500 ms, measured at 1.7 ms),
  **`run`**, **`test`**, **`check`**, **`fmt`**, **`build-assets`**, and
  **`build`** — which produces a folder you can send to somebody: the player,
  the engine's content, and the game.
- **Application identity**: a game built with `luaug build` carries its own icon
  in the artifact, verified by reading the resource back out of it.
- **A typed IDL** as the single source of truth for the public surface, from
  which the C++ registration, the `.d.luau` definitions, the api-dump and the
  API reference are all generated and freshness-gated.

### Known limits, stated plainly

Not in v1, each with an owner in the roadmap's post-v1 phases: a visual editor,
particles, decals, terrain, `SurfaceGui`, rich text, navmesh pathfinding, a 2D
workflow, multiplayer and replication, and mobile. `Sound.Content` plays a
generated tone rather than a file. `Enum.CollisionFidelity` round-trips while
every value collides as a box. Properties the engine stores and does not read
are marked `Inert` in the inspector and the api-dump, and a gate stops a new one
appearing quietly.
