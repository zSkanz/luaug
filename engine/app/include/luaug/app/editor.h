// The editor's model: what it has selected, where its 3D view is, and what the
// mouse has asked it to find. No ImGui in this header, for the same reason
// `inspector.h` has none -- what a panel *decides* is testable and what it
// *draws* is a screenshot's business, and mixing the two is how a picking bug
// ends up only reproducible by clicking.
//
// **This does not own the selection.** `Inspector` already does, the explorer
// and the properties panel already read it, and a second copy would be two
// answers to one question the first time a hot reload cleared one of them. The
// editor asks the inspector to select what a click found.
